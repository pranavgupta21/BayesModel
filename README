Description:
============
The project consists of implementations of two classifiers:
	1. Naive Bayes
	2. Full Bayes

The implementations are for simple requirements and have been written in Octave.

Requirements:
=============
To use any of the model:
	1. The model works only for single-label 2-class classification.
	2. The training data must be provided in the form of a matrix in a csv file. The rows of the matrix represent the data items and the columns represent the feature values. The last feature/columns represents the class label.
	3. The name of this file containing the labelled data should be explicilty changed in the .m file for either of the models.
	4. All feature values should be numerical.
	5. The class labels(last column) should be either a 0 or a 1.

Working:
========
	1. The naive bayes model discretizes the feature values into two categories:
		a. if the feature = 0 : category 1
		b. if the feature > 0 : category 2
	
	2. The full bayes model assumes normal (gaussian) distribution of all features.
	3. Both models assume independence of all the features.
